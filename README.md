# Fakenews Detection App as Serverless Function

This is a simple containerised app deployed on OpenFaaS as serverless function with the help of Kubernetes.

The app categorises news as fake or real based on data that was used to train machine learning models.

Eight ML models were applied in that regard: Passive Aggressive Classifier, Multinomial NB model, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron Criterion (Neural Network), Support Vector Machine, KNearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier.
